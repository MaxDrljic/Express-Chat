This is my simple Chat application made with NodeJS, Express and socket.io. There are two fields, one for entering your name and the other one for entering the message.

Whenever you click the send button, the message will be displayed on the screen. You can also send different messages using different usernames by opening another instance of localhost or doing it in the same instance, it is up to you.

SETUP :

1. Clone the repo.

2. cd into project.

3. Do `npm install`.

4. Fire `npm start` command.

5. Open localhost:4000 in your browser. You can change the localhost port in `index.js`.


Enjoy and have fun!
